Add number of nodes to the title bar		-	
Make an universal debug button 				-	DONE (03.09.2016)		
Use a color filter over each rect instead of changing the color of the objects.
Make the color of each rect be darker based on itÂ´s depth(m_level).


	

	BUGS:

		Objects are colored black at origin when using quadtree+ debug. UPDATE: objects now take the color of the current unicol.
		Debugmode cannot be turned off when in fixedgrid mode.	 FIXED.

		QUADTREE: some objects arent checked.
		


Progress:
